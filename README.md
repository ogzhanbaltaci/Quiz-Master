After finising the game, you will see your results depending on the outcome of your actions. Ass you can see on the top picture i have answered 0 out of 5 sports questions correctly. Thats why i get %0 score.

The core of the game was made by Gary Pettie from GameDev.tv Team. This game was a part of the 2D Unity course from udemy. After Mr.Gary finished the game i have made some additions to the game like a new wrong answer sprite to highlight the wrong answer, category system, 50:50 joker, score result screen for every category, new start screen, added audio for; start screen, correct answer, wrong answer, result screen and when a new questions comes. 

Thats all from me today see you on the next project!
